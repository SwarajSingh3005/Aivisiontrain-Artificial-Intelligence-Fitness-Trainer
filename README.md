# Abstract

Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with fitness training has revolutionized how individuals approach exercise routines. This thesis delves into the creation of Aivisiontrain, an AI-powered fitness trainer that addresses fitness-related inquiries and monitors real-time exercise performance. The implementation involves utilizing Python code to build a chatbot interfaced with OpenAI API for fitness inquiries and employing MediaPipe's library to monitor exercise execution through webcam analysis. The system is further extended to provide feedback and guidance during workout sessions. The Aivisiontrain potential for improving exercise accuracy, providing personalized routines, and promoting healthier lifestyles is explored.
